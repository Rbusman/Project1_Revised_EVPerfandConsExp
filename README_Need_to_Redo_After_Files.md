# Electric Vehicle Performance and Consumer Experiences


![Presentation_Cover_Image](<Presentation/Images/Cover_and_General/Presentation_Cover.png>)

##Project Purpose
---

We explored data on electric vehicle (EV) attributes, performance, charging, and consumer experiences with a focus on how these are related to:
- Attributes: Real-world fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions
- Costs:  The financial costs of buying and owning an EV
- Charging:  Charging times and trends
- Barriers:  Consumer barriers to EV adoption

##Project Questions
---
The questions for the projects were those we anticipated from an audience of vehicle manufacturers, EV engineers, and EV sales and marketing teams: 

- *Attributes: Real-world fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions*:
   - Which EV models and manufacturers have the highest fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions efficiencies?
   - When can we predict EVs will emit zero carbon dioxide and possibly contribute to carbon negativity?
- *Costs: The financial costs of buying and owning an EV*:
   - What is the greatest cost from owning an EV?
   - How do costs change over time?
- *Charging: Charging time and needs*:
   - What day of the week do most people charge EVs?
   - What is the average charge time and at what kilowatt-hours?
- *Barriers:  Consumer barriers to EV adoption*:  
   - Who is most likely to purchase an EV?
   - Why do people not purchase an EV?


##Secondary Research
---
Our first step was to conduct secondary research on EVs.   The secondary research helped in the following ways:
- Broaden our understanding of the existing research on EVs
- Identify our stakeholders
- Narrow areas for exploration
- Identify data sources

The secondary research exposed us to the variety of EV types on the market.  

![EVTypes](<Presentation/Images/Cover_and_General/EV_Types.png>)

Based on the secondary research, available datasets, and the current focus in popular media on EV cars, we opted to focus on EV cars (passenger cars and sports vehicles) for Project 1.  Accordingly, we preprocessed datasets so pickup truck and heavy utility vehicle data were not included in the analyses. 

Our primary audiences in the EV community would be:
- Vehicle manufacturers
- Engineers  and designers
- Dealerships

Our primary challenge during Project 1 ocurred during the secondary research.  There are several private companies who are growing their datasets on EV efficiency, performance, and consumer sentiment.  However, these companies charge substantial licensing fees to access their data. Ultimately, we had to rely on publicly accessible data readily available on government websites or made available to us after asking and waiting for permissions.  For more details on these data sources, please see the next section.  


## About the Data
---

Each of the Project 1 teammates focused on one of four topics:

### 1.) Attributes:  Real-world fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions

####Exploration(s):
- The relationship between EV model and real-world fuel economy
- Differences among manufacturers
- EV CO2 emission trends over time/time series forecast

####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:   Model, manufacturer, EV type (BEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, FCEVS) horsepower, weight, footprint/vehicle size, battery or engine, seating capacity

*Dependent variables/Labels*:  Fuel economy, CO2, Charging rate and speed
Sources:

####Data Source:
The primary dataset used for the explorations was the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) *Automotive Trends Data*.  The link to the complete dataset and supporting material follow:
https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data

The complete dataset can be filtered for specific variables, though this can be challenging and seemed dependent on the browser used with *internet explorer* proving more effective.

These are specific quotes from the EPA that characterize the dataset:
“The Trends database includes all new light-duty vehicles in the United States.”
“The Trends database has been maintained by EPA since 1975 and is updated annually to include the most up to date data available for all model years.”
“All data are based on production volumes delivered for sale in the U.S. by model year, and may vary from publicized data based on calendar year sales.”

#####*Licensure and Credits*:  
This dataset is open access. 
“Suggested data citation: US Environmental Protection Agency. 2023 EPA Automotive Trends Report. Data available at www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/explore-automotive-trends-data. Accessed December, 2023 and January, 2024.”

#####*Limitations of the Automotive Trends Data*:
The EPA's *Automotive Trends Data* did not start tracking EVs car models till 2010. Consequently, EV car models are a smaller subset of the much larger database. When interpreting findings about EVs from this dataset, it is recommended that the reader consider the limitations of a smaller sample size.    

### 2.) Costs:  The financial costs of buying and owning an EV
####Exploration(s):
* The five-year cost of owning an EV is compared to owning a hybrid and internal combustion (gas) engine type vehicles.
* Commercial vehicles such as semis and buses are excluded from the analysis.
* The seven major yearly costs depreciation, interest on the loan, taxes and fees, maintenance and repairs, insurance premiums, and fuel are considered.


####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:
- depreciation
   - On average, Edmund’s estimates that in the first year a typical vehicle will lose 23.5% of its manufacturer's suggested retail price and about 60% of its value after 5 years.
      - Estimates are based on auctions and retail data, supply and demand, pricing, incentives, redesign and improvements of newer models, like models, and the economy
   - interest on the loan
      - Based on tradition financing and not lease to own over a 60 months period
   - taxes and fees
      - assume 10% down payment
   - maintenance and repairs
      - estimated based on the manufacture's recommended suggestions as well as unscheduled types such as wheel alignments and replacement for wear and tear of the vehicle
   - insurance premiums
      - based on driving in mid-Michigan
   - fuel
      - Cost is based the manufactures recommended fuel type and is estimated based on an average person driving 15,000 miles/year, with an admixture of 45% highway driving and 55% city.
   
   
*Dependent variables/Labels*:
- year/age

####Data Source:\
The data was extracted from the Edmund's true cost of to own https://www.edmunds.com/tco.html for the vehicles.

#####*Limitations*:\
-The data was constrained for the 2023 model year due to the number of available EV on the market information from the website. The data is constrained to models costing $26k - $113k to purchase to make a fairer comparison with the different type of engines. The api is no longer open to the public, so the data was extracted into cvs for analysis.

The data was scaped using the python script in Code/EVPerformance/reading_tables.py. The purpose of this script was to find and extract values in tables from the http file and concat them into their respective csv files found in Code/EVPerformance/Resources.

### 3.) Charging:  Charging times and trends
####Exploration(s):

####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:   

*Dependent variables/Labels*:  

####Data Source:

#####*Licensure and Credits*:  

#####*Limitations*: 

### 4.) Barriers: Consumer barriers to EV adoption
####Exploration(s):
 - The reasons consumers are hesitant to adopt EVs
 - Demographics of EV buyers
 - Concerns of consumers
 - Exposure of consumers to EVs

####Possible variables:
*Independent variables/Features*:   Types/models available, price, 

*Dependent variables/Labels*:  Charging - locations, rates, speed, number of units available

####Data Source: 2022 BEV and LCF Survey Report_FINAL_2 (consumerreports.org) and More Americans Would Buy an EV | Interest in Low-Carbon Fuels - Consumer Reports

#####*Licensure and Credits*:  This data set is open access.


#####*Limitations*: A large amount of the data regarding consumers was in reports, rather than data sets giving opinions and reasons to adopt and/or not adopt.

![FCast](<Presentation/Images/EVAttributes/FCast.png>)

#####Takeaway:
EVs are trending toward zero CO2 emissions by 2027.  However, the small sample size does limite this interpretation.  


### 2.) Costs: The financial costs of buying and owning an EV:

#### Exploration:  How do costs change over time?
#####Code:

see source code in Code/EVPerformance/
EVPerformance/analysis_5year_ownership_all.ipynb

#####Takeaway:
<figure>
<img src = "Presentation/Images/EVPerformance/cost.png", alt = "cost">
<figcaption> Fig cost: The yearly cost to own for a internal combustion (left panel), hybrid (center panel) and electric type(right panel) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

The absolute total yearly cost to own for all internal combustion, hybrid and electric vehicle models being considered is plotted in Fig cost. Each line color represents a different model car. In each case, the first year of ownership appears to be the most expensive. There are large variations in the cost for the first year due to the large range of car prices being considered. After the first year, the fluctuations in the cost of ownership between each model vehicles decreases. 

<figure>
<img src = "Presentation/Images/EVPerformance/cost_per_mile.png", alt = "cost_per_mile">
<figcaption> Fig cost/year: The average yearly cost/millage to own for a internal combustion (left panel), hybrid (center panel) and electric (right panel) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

To interpret the typical cost of based on the engine type, the average cost per mile of ownership is calculated and displayed in fig cost/year. The cost is further broken down into the seven major yearly expenses being considered in this case study: depreciation, interest on the loan, taxes and fees, maintenance and repairs, insurance premiums, and fuel. In general, the figure illustrates how the maintained and repairs will increase over time due to wear and tear while the total cost due to depreciation, financing and taxes and fees decreases with the age of the vehicle.

#### Exploration:  What is the greatest cost from owning an EV?
#####Takeaway:

In each case, the first year has the largest expense. It is obvious that the electric vehicles are the most expensive to own the 1st year than the internal combustion engines by \$0.55/mile, while the hybrid cars cost \$0.32/mile more. In the second year, the cost of ownership decreases significantly by about 50%-65% compared to the first year. After 5 years, it cost on average \$4.33/mile, \$4.78/mile and \$4.09/mile to maintain an electric, hybrid and internal combustion type car, respectively. This means that the breakeven point of an electric and hybrid car compared to an gas/diesel is more slightly more than 5 years.


<figure>
<img src = "Presentation/Images/EVPerformance/depreciation.png", alt = "depreciation"> 
<figcaption> Fig depreciation: The average yearly depreciation for a internal combustion (top panels), hybrid (middle panels) and electric (bottom panels) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Fig depreciation is the breakdown of the yearly cost of the largest expense, the depreciation verses the initial cost of the vehicle. There is a clear linear correlation between most of the models vs cost. This indicates that one can decrease the cost of ownership by buying a cheaper vehicle. The gradients of the ev and internal combustion engines are similar for the first two years, but the offsets for the ev is larger indicating that regardless of which price point one choices, the depreciation for the ev will be larger during these two years. There appears to be a few higher priced evs that seems to retain their value, i.e. smaller depreciation. These few models represent the exception to the linear trend observed. 

<figure>
<img src = "Presentation/Images/EVPerformance/YearlyPercentageOfCost.png", alt = "Yearly%ofCost"> <figcaption> Fig Yearly Percentage of Cost: The average yearly depreciation for a internal combustion (left panel), hybrid (center panel) and electric (right panel) vehicles.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Fig. Yearly Percentage of Cost is the normalized distribution of the cost for each year for each engine type. After the first year, roughly 30% of the cost to own can be attributed to the depreciation while the insurance premiums and taxes and fees contributes 11-20% and 1.5-2.5%, respectively. The financing cost drops significantly as one starts to pay off the car, but the maintenance and repairs increases.

### 3.) Charging: Charging time and needs:
#### Exploration:  What day of the week do most people charge EVs?
#####Code:
```
## Dependencies
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

## Convert excel file generated by API to a Pandas dataframe.
df = pd.read_excel('/Users/kim/Desktop/ev.charge.xlsx')

## Groupby 'weekday' and calculate the mean of 'chargeTimeHrs'
average_charge_time = df.groupby('weekday')['chargeTimeHrs'].mean()

## Sort the average charge time in descending order
average_charge_time2 = average_charge_time.sort_values(ascending=False)

##Plot
average_charge_time2.plot(kind='bar')

# Add labels and title
plt.title('Average Charge Time by Weekday')
plt.xlabel('Weekday')
plt.ylabel('Average Charge Time (Hrs)')

#Show plot
plt.show()

```
#####Graph:
![EVCharge_TBWD](<Presentation/Images/EVCharging/EVCharge_TBWD.png>)

#####Takeaway:
Average overall charge is 2.82 hours, using 5.81kW. Charge times are greatest on Wednesdays with an average of 2.94 hours needed to charge an EV. Sunday is the lowest at 2.1 hours. It is not until the weekend days that we see a substantial drop in the hours needed to charge an electric vehicle. There is only a gradual decline over the days of the work week.

#### What is the average charge time and at what kilowatt-hours?
#####Code:
#####Graph:
#####Takeaway:

### 4.) Barriers:  Consumer barriers to EV adoption:  
#### Exploration:  Who is most likely to purchase an EV?
#####Graph:  ![FCast](<Presentation/Images/ConsumerExperience/BarriersToEVAdoption.png>)
#####Takeaway: The demographics of a typical EV buyer are male, young adult, with a higher education, a higher income level and live in an urban area. 

#### Exploration:  Why do people not purchase an EV?
#####Code:
#####Graph:  ![FCast](<Presentation/Images/ConsumerExperience/ConsumerConcerns.png>)
#####Takeaway: The majority of consumers are not knowledgeable on the subject of Electric Vehicles.  Without this knowledge, they are hesitant to make a purchase.
